            <p>Yale University’s namesake is Elihu Yale, a slave trader and the governor of the British East India Company responsible for over a century of colonial rule in India. This Critical History Map was developed with two ambitions in mind: (1) to think about how Yale’s history as a colonial institution remains embedded in its architecture and landscape in the present-day and (2) to highlight sites where Yale students and New Haven residents have changed the course of the university’s history through remarkable moments of struggle.</p>
