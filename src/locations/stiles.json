    "text": "This plaque, installed in the Ezra Stiles common room in 2016, was written by then-Head of College Stephen Pitti, Professor of History, American Studies, and Ethnicity, Race & Migration. Ezra Stiles is not the only space with evidence of Yale's colonial origins, but it is a unique instance where these origins have been made visible, thanks to Professor Pitti. In many cases, Yale's colonial past has been concealed, either intentionally or incidentally. \nWhat does it mean to walk into a college named after Ezra Stiles and also acknowledge and remember the slaves and servants he owned: Newport, Jacob, and Aaron?"
